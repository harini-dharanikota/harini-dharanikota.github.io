abstract: 'Background
In order to identify opportunities to streamline hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) multidisciplinary teams (MDT) for cancer care, it is important to first document variability in MDT team practices worldwide. We aimed to develop a comprehensive checklist of parameters to evaluate existing practices and guide the development of MDTs for new cancer services.
Methods
Participants were recruited via the International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (IHPBA) and European-African HPB Association (E-AHPBA) and emailed an anonymised online survey. The survey comprised 29 questions, including a combination of closed-ended and open-ended questions. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and inductive content analysis.
Results
Analysing 72 responses from 31 countries, we found substantial variations in HPB MDT practices across regions. Notable variability was found in core team composition, chairing practices, caseload planning, information practices and MDT audit practices. Issues impacting efficiency were common to many MDTs.
Discussion
MDT care is understood and applied differently across the world. There is a lack of standardisation of practice, and an apparent need for better case preparation, effective specialist contribution, improved audit frequency and metrics to improve performance. It may be valuable to consider human factors while designing MDTs to support team decision processes, minimise errors, and enhance efficiency.'
