title: "Cognitive load management: an invaluable tool for safe and effective surgical training"
category: manuscripts
abstract: "This article highlights the importance of considering Cognitive Load (CL) and Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) during surgical training, focusing on the acquisition of intra-operative skills. It describes the basis of CLT with the overarching aim of describing CLT-based techniques to enhance current training strategies and surgical performance, many of which are instinctively already employed in surgical practice. Currently, methods of feedback and assessment are imperfect - typically subjective, unsystematic, opportunistic, or retrospective, and at risk of human bias. Surgical Sabermetrics, the advanced analytics of surgical and audio-visual data, aims to enhance this feedback by providing objective, real-time, digital-based feedback. This article introduces the benefit of real-time measurement of CL to enhance feedback and its applications to surgical performance that follow the ethos of Surgical Sabermetrics.1 The 2022 theme for ICOSET was “Making it Better.” Cognitive Load and Surgical Sabermetrics principles provide tools to make Surgical training better, with the goal of higher quality care for patients."
