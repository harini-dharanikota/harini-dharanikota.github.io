title: "Debiasing Judgements Using a Distributed Cognition Approach: A Scoping Review of Technological Strategies"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
abstract: 'Shifting the focus of debiasing from individuals to systems, technological debiasing strategies involve designing system components to minimise the negative impacts of cognitive bias on performance. Through the lens of distributed cognition theory, technological debiasing represents a reconceptualisation of cognitive bias mitigation, showing promise for real-world application.'
